# A-B-testing
An Applied A/B Testing Analysis to Evaluate Discount Strategy Impact on Business Profit
# 📊 A/B Testing for Business Decision Making using Python

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **A/B Testing and statistical analysis** can be used to make **data-driven business decisions** instead of relying on assumptions or intuition.

The project uses a real-world retail dataset (Superstore) to compare two business strategies:

- **Variant A:** Low Discount Strategy (≤ 20% discount)
- **Variant B:** High Discount Strategy (> 20% discount)

The main business question is:

> Does offering higher discounts actually improve business performance, or does it hurt profitability?

---

## 🧠 Why A/B Testing?

Modern companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Meta use **A/B testing** to test changes safely before rolling them out to everyone.

A/B testing helps businesses:

- Reduce risk
- Avoid wrong decisions
- Improve profit and performance
- Make decisions based on data, not guesswork

Instead of assuming which strategy is better, this project uses **real data and statistical methods** to find the answer.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A retail business wants to choose between:

- A low discount strategy (higher margin, possibly lower sales)
- A high discount strategy (higher sales, possibly lower profit)

The goal is to determine:

> Which strategy is better for the business in terms of profitability and sustainability?

---

## 🧪 What This Project Does

1. Loads and cleans real retail sales data.
2. Creates two experimental groups (A and B) based on discount level.
3. Performs:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization
   - Statistical hypothesis testing (t-test)
   - Effect size analysis (Cohen’s d)
   - Confidence interval estimation
4. Validates results across:
   - Product categories
   - Regions
5. Produces a **final data-driven business recommendation**.

## 📊 Visual Analysis

The project uses two main visualizations:

1. **Profit Distribution (Boxplot)** – to compare spread, risk, and outliers.
2. **Mean Profit Comparison (Bar Chart)** – to directly compare average performance.

These graphs support the statistical analysis and help in business interpretation.

---

## 🧪 Statistical Methods Used

- **t-test**: To check whether the difference between Variant A and Variant B is statistically significant.
- **Effect Size (Cohen’s d)**: To measure how big the business impact is.
- **Confidence Interval**: To estimate the real-world range of the profit difference.

This ensures that decisions are:
- Reliable
- Scientifically valid
- Not based on random fluctuations

---

## 🧩 Segment-wise and Region-wise Validation

In real businesses, one strategy may work in one category or region but fail in another.

Therefore, this project also performs:
- Category-wise A/B testing
- Region-wise A/B testing

This makes the conclusion more **robust and realistic**.

---

## 🏁 Final Outcome

At the end, the project:

- Determines whether the difference between strategies is statistically significant
- Identifies which strategy performs better
- Provides a **clear business recommendation based on data**

This turns the analysis into a **decision-making system**, not just a report.
